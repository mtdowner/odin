    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>It's no secret living a life of crime typically leads to living a life inside of a cage, possibly surrounded by some scary animals. What if, however, one's only crime was that of being born? And, to top it all off, these are German Shepherds trapped with nowhere to go after being dumped on the side of a road..</p>
    <p>Thank Doggy Heaven, though, because we are here to rectify this situation. We're on a mission to rescue these sweet puppies from the evil bars they live behind.</p>
    <p>Now, let's get ready to break our soon-to-be friends out of doggy prison!</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>

    <p>Before we become a doggy-fugitive camp, there are quite a few rules to go over and many tools we'll need in order to be successful.</p>
    <ul>

      <li>Pen and paper</li>
      <li>A strong internet connection</li>
      <li>A lint roller.. or two...</li>
      <li>Matching Welcome Home tees for all!</li>
    </ul>

      <li>Establish a secure online connection.</li>
      <li>Search every single rescue/shelter in your area for German Shepherds.</li>
      <li>Make a record of each one you find.</li>
      <li>Contact each location to get more information about the doggy prisoners.</li>
      <li>Sort your data according to age and time served.</li>
