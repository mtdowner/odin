    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Your new family members will always be there for you, and some will even go as far as giving up their own life to protect yours. Always, always show your love and appreciation for your furry family.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Chew toys</li>
      <li>Tennis balls</li>
      <li>Brushes</li>
      <li>Doggy shampoo</li>
      <li>Dog shoes</li>
      <li>As many bones as you can get</li>
      <li>Access to a hose for summertime water gymnastics</li>
      <li>Tons of sticks</li>
      <li>And much more! The list is endless!</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>Set aside several hours (12 should suffice)</li>
      <li>Brush each dog daily to keep up with the shedding (jk nothing stops the shedding so enjoy being covered in fur
        for the rest of your life!)</li>
      <li>Rotate rigorous activities daily such as: hiking, running, playing fetch, and swimming</li>
      <li>As you get to know your new family, you'll know what they individually need, but keeping them mentally
        stimulated is just as important as physical exercise.</li>
    </ol>
