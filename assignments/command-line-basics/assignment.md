# Assignment

Many of these resources assume you’re using a Mac or Linux environment. If you did our previous installation lesson, you should already have Linux installed in dual-boot or a virtual machine. Or, you might be using macOS. If you don’t have macOS, or any version of Linux installed, please return to the operating system installation guide.

1. Visit The Unix Shell course designed by the Software Carpentry Foundation. There you will find a full complement of lessons on using the CLI, but for now just focus on completing the following lessons:

- Download files
- Introducing the Shell
- Navigating Files and Directories
- Working With Files and Directories
- Pipes and Filters

2. With your newly discovered CLI super powers, practice creating a folder and a few files using the mkdir, touch, and cd commands introduced in the previous step. As an example, a basic website might have a main index.html file, a CSS stylesheet file called style.css, and a folder for images. Think about how you could create these files with the commands and put it into practice!

3. Let’s practice creating files and directories and deleting them! You’ll need to enter the commands for the steps below in your terminal. If you can’t recall how to open a terminal, scroll up for a reminder.

1. Create a new directory in your home directory with the name test.
2. Navigate to the test directory.
3. Create a new file called test.txt. Hint: use the touch or echo command.
4. Open your newly created file in VSCode and make some changes, save the file, and close it.
5. Navigate back out of the test directory.
6. Delete the test directory.

That’s it—you’re done with practice! If you commit to doing most things from the command line from here on out, these commands will become second nature to you. Moving and copying files is much more efficiently done through the command line, even if it feels like more of a hassle at this point.
