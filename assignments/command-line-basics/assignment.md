# Assignment

1. Visit [The Unix Shell](https://swcarpentry.github.io/shell-novice/) course designed by the Software Carpentry Foundation. There you will find a full complement of lessons on using the CLI, but for now just focus on completing the following lessons:

- [Download files](https://swcarpentry.github.io/shell-novice/#download-files) - only follow the instructions in this section, you don’t need to install any software and can move onto the next bullet point in this list.
- [Introducing the Shell](https://swcarpentry.github.io/shell-novice/01-intro.html)
- [Navigating Files and Directories](https://swcarpentry.github.io/shell-novice/02-filedir.html)
- [Working With Files and Directories](https://swcarpentry.github.io/shell-novice/03-create.html)
- [Pipes and Filters](https://swcarpentry.github.io/shell-novice/04-pipefilter.html)

2. With your newly discovered CLI super powers, practice creating a folder and a few files using the `mkdir`, `touch`, and `cd` commands introduced in the previous step. As an example, a basic website might have a main `index.html` file, a CSS stylesheet file called `style.css`, and a folder for `images`. Think about how you could create these files with the commands and put it into practice!

3. Let’s practice creating files and directories and deleting them! You’ll need to enter the commands for the steps below in your terminal. If you can’t recall how to open a terminal, scroll up for a reminder.

1. Create a new directory in your home directory with the name `test`.
2. Navigate to the `test` directory.
3. Create a new file called `test.txt`. *Hint: use the `touch` or `echo` command.*
4. Open your newly created file in VSCode and make some changes, save the file, and close it.
5. Navigate back out of the `test` directory.
6. Delete the `test` directory.

That’s it—you’re done with practice! If you commit to doing most things from the command line from here on out, these commands will become second nature to you. Moving and copying files is much more efficiently done through the command line, even if it feels like more of a hassle at this point.
