  <h1>This is just a basic website for The Odin Project</h1>
  <p>It has a stylesheet and JavaScript file linked. You'll also find a directory that holds images like these ones:</p>
  <img src="images/dog1.png" alt="Black dog with piercing blue eyes doing a head tilt." />
  <img src="images/dog2.png" alt="A silly German Shepherd lying on a hotel bed with a seemingly sorrowful look on his face." />
