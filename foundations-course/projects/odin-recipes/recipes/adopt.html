    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>It's no secret living a life of crime typically leads to living a life inside of a cage, possibly surrounded by some scary animals. What if, however, one's only crime was that of being born? And, to top it all off, these are German Shepherds trapped with nowhere to go after being dumped on the side of a road..</p>
    <p>Thank Doggy Heaven, though, because we are here to rectify this situation. We're on a mission to rescue these sweet puppies from the evil bars they live behind.</p>
    <p>Now, let's get ready to break our soon-to-be friends out of doggy prison!</p>
