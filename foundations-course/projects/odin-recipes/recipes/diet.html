    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Take a minute to think about this question: would you like it if your dog fed you the same dry food everyday for every single meal? Studies aren't out yet, but the results would probably show a big fluffy "NOPE!"</p>
  <p>Now, imagine how delightful it would be if dogs had their very own in-house Five-Paw Chef. Lucky for you, it's easy because it turns out dogs aren't all that picky and don't care what they eat!</p>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
  <p>Make sure to cook for your flock three times a day to keep them happy and healthy. You may need to hire some help to clean up any presents left behind throughout the day.</p>
  
    <ol>
      <li>Provide one piece of bone marrow every time your pups do something extra cute</li>
      <li>Cut up the raw steak into equal portions for each dog</li>
      <li>Deliver on a silver platter</li>
      <li>Repeat three times a day or mealtime per your feeding schedule</li>
    </ol>
