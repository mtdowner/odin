## [Foundations Course](https://www.theodinproject.com/paths/foundations/courses/foundations)

Welcome to my repo, a repo that showcases a mess progressing painfully slow into a not-so-much mess.

Come, share some laughs and tears with me as I attempt The Odin Project. All of my project files are in this repo as well as live examples 8n chronological order. View everything [here](https://mtdowner.github.io/odin/).

All assignment instructions are included with each exercise and project under README.md
